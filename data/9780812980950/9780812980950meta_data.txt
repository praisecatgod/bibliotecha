There were always little reminders pasted on the kitchen wall. For example, the word THINK. I found THINK thumbtacked on a bulletin board in her darkroom. I saw it Scotch-taped on a pencil box she\u2019d collaged. I even found a pamphlet titled THINK on her bedside table. Mom liked to THINK.\n \u00a0\n So begins Diane Keaton\u2019s unforgettable memoir about her mother and herself. In it you will meet the woman known to tens of millions as Annie Hall, but you will also meet, and fall in love with, her mother, the loving, complicated, always-thinking Dorothy Hall. To write about herself, Diane realized she had to write about her mother, too, and how their bond came to define both their lives. In a remarkable act of creation, Diane not only reveals herself to us, she also lets us meet in intimate detail her mother. Over the course of her life, Dorothy kept eighty-five journals\u2014literally thousands of pages\u2014in which she wrote about her marriage, her children, and, most probingly, herself. Dorothy also recorded memorable stories about Diane\u2019s grandparents. Diane has sorted through these pages to paint an unflinching portrait of her mother\u2014a woman restless with intellectual and creative energy, struggling to find an outlet for her talents\u2014as well as her entire family, recounting a story that spans four generations and nearly a hundred years.\n \u00a0\n More than the autobiography of a legendary actress, Then Again is a book about a very American family with very American dreams. Diane will remind you of yourself, and her bonds with her family will remind you of your own relationships with those you love the most.\n \u00a0\n Look for special features inside.\u00a0Join the Circle for author chats and more."], "title": ["Then Again"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780812980950", "Publisher: Random House Publishing Group", "Publication date: 5/1/2012", "Edition description: Reprint", "Pages: 336", "Sales rank: 132079", "Product dimensions: 8.20 (w) x 5.60 (h) x 0.96 (d)"], "authors": ["Diane Keaton"]}
