Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.\nNo book except perhaps Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin had as powerful an impact on the abolitionist movement as Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass. But while Stowe wrote about imaginary characters, Douglass\u2019s book is a record of his own remarkable life.\nBorn a slave in 1818 on a plantation in Maryland, Douglass taught himself to read and write. In 1845, seven years after escaping to the North, he published Narrative, the first of three autobiographies. This book calmly but dramatically recounts the horrors and the accomplishments of his early years\u2014the daily, casual brutality of the white masters; his painful efforts to educate himself; his decision to find freedom or die; and his harrowing but successful escape.\nAn astonishing orator and a skillful writer, Douglass became a newspaper editor, a political activist, and an eloquent spokesperson for the civil rights of African Americans. He lived through the Civil War, the end of slavery, and the beginning of segregation. He was celebrated internationally as the leading black intellectual of his day, and his story still resonates in ours.\nRobert O\u2019Meally is Zora Neale Hurston Professor of Literature at Columbia University and the Director of Columbia University\u2019s Center for Jazz Studies. He wrote the introduction and notes to the Barnes & Noble classics edition of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."], "title": ["Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9781593080419", "Publisher: Barnes & Noble", "Publication date: 11/1/2003", "Series:\nBarnes & Noble Classics Series", "Pages: 160", "Sales rank: 12712", "Product dimensions: 8.04 (w) x 5.22 (h) x 0.47 (d)"], "authors": ["Frederick Douglass", "Robert G.
