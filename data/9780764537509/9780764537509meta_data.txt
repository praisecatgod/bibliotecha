{"overview": ["In the days before personal computers, BASIC was the easy programming language to learn, and serious programmers learned FORTRAN or COBOL to do \u201creal work.\u201d Today, many people have discovered that Perl is both a great beginning programming language and\u00a0one that enables them to write powerful programs with little effort.\nIf you\u2019re interested in discovering how to program (or how others program), Perl For Dummies, 4th Edition, is for you. If you already know something about programming (but not about Perl), this book is also for you. If you\u2019re already an expert programmer, you\u2019re still welcome to read this book; you can just skip the basic stuff (you never know what kind of new tips and tricks you\u2019ll pick up).\nThis reference guide shows you how to use Perl under many different operating systems, such as UNIX, many flavors of Windows (Windows 95/98, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows Me, and Windows XP), and Macintosh OS 9 and OS X; in fact, Perl runs on many more operating systems than these.\nHere's a sampling of what Perl For Dummies, 4th Edition, has to offer:\n\nInstalling Perl on various platforms\nNailing down the basics of building Perl programs\nWorking with text and numbers\nConstructing lists and working with them\nCreating conditionals and loops\nDelving into more advanced features such as operators and functions\nReading and writing files and directories\nUsing subroutines for modularity\nDemystifying Web server programs\nCreating your own Internet clients\n\nThe Perl programming language enables you to write fully working computer programs with just a few steps. It\u2019s particularly good at common programming tasks, such as reading and writing text files, but it also excels at reducing the work that programmers have to do. Perl For Dummies, 4th Edition, shows you how to do all of that and how to modify programs to your heart\u2019s content. After all, one of the common phrases in the world of Perl programmers is, \u201cThere's more than one way to do it.\u201d"], "title": ["Perl For Dummies"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780764537509", "Publisher: Wiley", "Publication date: 3/7/2003", "Series:\nFor Dummies Series", "Edition description: Fourth Edition", "Edition number: 4", "Pages: 408", "Sales rank: 351499", "Product dimensions: 7.40 (w) x 9.16 (h) x 0.93 (d)"], "authors": ["Paul Hoffman"]}
