{"overview": ["Do lobsters feel pain? Did Franz Kafka have a funny bone? What is John Updike's deal, anyway? And what happens when adult-video starlets meet their fans in person? David Foster Wallace answers these questions and more in essays that are enthralling narrative adventures. Whether covering the three-ring circus of a vicious presidential race, plunging into the wars between dictionary writers, or confronting the World's Largest Lobster Cooker, Wallace projects a quality of thought that is uniquely his and a voice as powerful and distinct as any in American letters."], "title": ["Consider the Lobster: And Other Essays"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780316013321", "Publisher: Little, Brown and Company", "Publication date: 7/2/2007", "Edition description: Reprint", "Pages: 352", "Sales rank: 58408", "Product dimensions: 5.50 (w) x 8.12 (h) x 1.00 (d)"], "authors": ["David Foster Wallace"]}
