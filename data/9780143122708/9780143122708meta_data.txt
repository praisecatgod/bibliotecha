{"overview": ["The breakthrough story collection that established A. M. Homes as one of the most daring writers of her generation\n\u00a0\nOriginally published in 1990 to wide critical acclaim, this extraordinary first collection of stories by A. M. Homes confronts the real and the surreal on even terms to create a disturbing and sometimes hilarious vision of the American dream. Included here are \"Adults Alone,\" in which a couple drops their kids off at Grandma's and gives themselves over to ten days of Nintendo, porn videos, and crack; \"A Real Doll,\" in which a girl's blond Barbie doll seduces her teenaged brother; and \"Looking for Johnny,\" in which a kidnapped boy, having failed to meet his abductor's expectations, is returned home. These stories, by turns satirical, perverse, unsettling, and utterly believable, expose the dangers of ordinary life even as their characters stay hidden behind the disguises they have so carefully created."], "title": ["The Safety of Objects: Stories"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780143122708", "Publisher: Viking Penguin", "Publication date: 1/29/2013", "Pages: 208", "Sales rank: 768240", "Product dimensions: 5.00 (w) x 7.60 (h) x 0.70 (d)"], "authors": ["A.
