{"overview": ["Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award\n\u00a0\n The hero of John Updike\u2019s Rabbit, Run, ten years after the events of Rabbit Redux, has come to enjoy considerable prosperity as the chief sales representative of Springer Motors, a Toyota agency in Brewer, Pennsylvania. The time is 1979: Skylab is falling, gas lines are lengthening, and double-digit inflation coincides with a deflation of national self-confidence. Nevertheless, Harry \u201cRabbit\u201d Angstrom feels in good shape, ready to enjoy life at last\u2014until his wayward son, Nelson, returns from the West, and the image of an old love pays a visit to the lot. New characters and old populate these scenes from Rabbit\u2019s middle age as he continues to pursue, in his zigzagging fashion, the rainbow of happiness.\nWinner of the 1982 National Book Award"], "title": ["Rabbit Is Rich"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780449911822", "Publisher: Random House Publishing Group", "Publication date: 8/28/1996", "Series:\nRabbit Quartet                                                                                                          ,\n                                #3", "Edition description: Reissue", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 432", "Sales rank: 156186", "Lexile: 1180L\n                                (what's this?)", "Product dimensions: 5.46 (w) x 8.24 (h) x 1.14 (d)"], "authors": ["John Updike"]}
