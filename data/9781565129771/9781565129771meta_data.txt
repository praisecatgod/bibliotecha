{"overview": ["Rural Wisconsin, 1909. In the bitter cold, Ralph Truitt, a successful businessman, stands alone on a train platform waiting for the woman who answered his newspaper advertisement for \"a reliable wife.\" But when Catherine Land steps off the train from Chicago, she's not the \"simple, honest woman\" that Ralph is expecting. She is both complex and devious, haunted by a terrible past and motivated by greed. Her plan is simple: she will win this man's devotion, and then, ever so slowly, she will poison him and leave Wisconsin a wealthy widow. What she has not counted on, though, is that Truitt \u2014 a passionate man with his own dark secrets \u2014has plans of his own for his new wife. Isolated on a remote estate and imprisoned by relentless snow, the story of Ralph and Catherine unfolds in unimaginable ways. \nWith echoes of Wuthering Heights and Rebecca, Robert Goolrick's intoxicating debut novel delivers a classic tale of suspenseful seduction, set in a world that seems to have gone temporarily off its axis."], "title": ["A Reliable Wife"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9781565129771", "Publisher: Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill", "Publication date: 1/5/2010", "Pages: 320", "Sales rank: 147749", "Product dimensions: 5.58 (w) x 8.02 (h) x 0.96 (d)"], "authors": ["Robert Goolrick"]}
