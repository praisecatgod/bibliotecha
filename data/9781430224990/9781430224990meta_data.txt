{"overview": ["Spring addresses most aspects of Java/Java EE application development and offers simple solutions to them. By using Spring, you will be lead to use industry best practices to design and implement your applications. The releases of Spring 2.x added many improvements and new features to the 1.x versions. Spring Recipes: A Problem\u0096Solution Approach focuses on Spring 2.5 features for building enterprise Java applications.\nSpring Recipes covers Spring 2.5 from basic to advanced, including Spring IoC container, Spring AOP and AspectJ, Spring data access support, Spring transaction management, Spring Web and Portlet MVC, Spring testing support, Spring support for remoting, EJB, JMS, JMX, E\u0096mail, scheduling, and scripting languages. This book also introduces several common Spring Portfolio projects that will bring significant value to your application development, including Spring Security, Spring Web Flow, and Spring Web Services.\nThe topics in this book are introduced by complete and real\u0096world code examples that you can follow step by step. Instead of abstract descriptions on complex concepts, you will find live examples in this book. When you start a new project, you can consider copying the code and configuration files from this book, and then modifying them for your needs. This can save you a great deal of work over creating a project from scratch.\nWhat you\u2019ll learn\n\nInstalling the Spring framework and Spring IDE, using the Spring IoC container and the Spring application context\nUnderstanding aspect-oriented programming concepts, using classic and new Spring AOP, integrating Spring with AspectJ, and load\u0096time weaving aspects\nUsing Spring to simplify data access (with JDBC, Hibernate, and JPA) and manage transactions programmatically and declaratively\nBuilding web applications and portlets with Spring Web MVC and Portlet MVC, and integrating Spring with Struts, JSF, and DWR\nUnderstanding the unit testing and integration testing concepts, and Spring\u2019s unit and integration testing support (on JUnit 3.8, JUnit 4, and TestNG)\nUsing Spring\u2019s support for remoting technologies (RMI, Hessian, Burlap, and HTTP Invoker), EJB, JMS, JMX, E-mail, scheduling, and scripting languages\nUnderstanding security concepts (authentication, authorization, and access control), and securing web applications using Spring Security\nManaging complex web application page flows using Spring Web Flow, and integrating Spring Web Flow with JSF\nExposing contract\u0096last web services using XFire, and developing contract\u0096first web services using Spring Web Services\n\nWho this book is for\nThis book is for Java developers who would like to gain hands\u0096on experience rapidly on Java/Java EE development using the Spring framework. If you are already a developer using Spring in your projects, you can also use this book as a reference, and you\u2019ll find the code examples very useful.\nYou don\u2019t need much Java EE experience to read this book. However, it assumes that you know the basics of object\u0096oriented programming with Java (e.g., creating a class/interface, implementing an interface, extending a base class, running a main class, setting up your classpath, and so on). It also assumes you have basic knowledge on web and database concepts and know how to create dynamic web pages and query databases with SQL statements."], "title": ["Spring Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9781430224990", "Publisher: Apress", "Publication date: 9/1/2010", "Edition number: 2", "Pages: 1104", "Sales rank: 1399168", "Product dimensions: 7.76 (w) x 11.08 (h) x 2.20 (d)"], "authors": ["Gary Mak", "Daniel Rubio", "Josh Long"]}
