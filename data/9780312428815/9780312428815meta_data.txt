{"overview": ["First published in 1993, The Virgin Suicides announced the arrival of a major new American novelist. In a quiet suburb of Detroit, the five Lisbon sisters--beautiful, eccentric, and obsessively watched by the neighborhood boys--commit suicide one by one over the course of a single year. As the boys observe them from afar, transfixed, they piece together the mystery of the family's fatal melancholy, in this hypnotic and unforgettable novel of adolescent love, disquiet, and death. Jeffrey Eugenides evokes the emotions of youth with haunting sensitivity and dark humor and creates a coming-of-age story unlike any of our time. Adapted into a critically acclaimed film by Sofia Coppola, The Virgin Suicides is a modern classic, a lyrical and timeless tale of sex and suicide that transforms and mythologizes suburban middle-American life.\nAn unforgettable first novel about adolescence -- told by a \"collective\" narrator whose wry, intelligent voice speaks for an eclectic band of teenage trespassers, hborhood like so many sleuths. The first chapter appeared in The Paris Review, where it won the 1991 Aga Khan Prize for Fiction."], "title": ["Virgin Suicides"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780312428815", "Publisher: Picador", "Publication date: 4/27/2009", "Edition description: First Edition", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 256", "Sales rank: 40317", "Product dimensions: 8.26 (w) x 5.54 (h) x 0.68 (d)"], "authors": ["Jeffrey Eugenides"]}
