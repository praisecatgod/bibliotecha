{"overview": ["Augusten Burroughs meets Mary Karr: a deeply funny and wickedly entertaining family memoir\nThe youngest of four daughters in an old, celebrated St. Louis family of prominent journalists and politicians on one side, debutantes and equestrians on the other, Jeanne Darst grew up hearing stories of past grandeur. And the message she internalized as a young girl was clear: While things might be a bit tight for us right now, it\u2019s only temporary. Soon her father would sell the Great American Novel and reclaim the family\u2019s former glory.\nThe Darsts uproot themselves and move from St. Louis to New York. Jeanne\u2019s father writes one novel, and then another, which don\u2019t find publishers. This, combined with her mother\u2019s burgeoning alcoholism\u2014nightly booze-fueled weepathons reminiscing about her fancy childhood\u2014lead to financial disaster and divorce. And as Jeanne becomes an adult, she is horrified to discover that she is not only a drinker like her mother, but a writer like her father.\nAt first, and for years, she embraces both activities\u2014living in an apartment with no bathroom, stealing food from her babysitting gigs, and raising rent money by riding the subway topless and performing a one-woman show in her living room. Until gradually she realizes that this life has not been thrust on her in some handing-down-of-the-writing-mantle-way. She has chosen it; and until she can stop putting drinking and writing ahead of everything else, it\u2019s a questionable choice. \u201cFor a long time I was worried about becoming my father,\u201d she writes. \u201cThen I was worried about becoming my mother. Now I was worried about becoming myself.\u201d\nUltimately, Darst sets out to discover whether a person can have the writing without the ruin, whether it\u2019s possible to be both sober and creative, ambitious and happy, a professional author and a parent. Filled with brilliantly flawed, idiosyncratic characters and punctuated by Darst\u2019s irreverent eye for absurdity, Fiction Ruined My Family is a lovingly told, wickedly funny portrait of an unconventional life."], "title": ["Fiction Ruined My Family"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9781594486173", "Publisher: Penguin Group (USA) Incorporated", "Publication date: 11/6/2012", "Pages: 320", "Sales rank: 373314", "Product dimensions: 5.56 (w) x 8.20 (h) x 0.85 (d)"], "authors": ["Jeanne Darst"]}
