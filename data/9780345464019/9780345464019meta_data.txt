{"overview": ["\u201cA rollicking, adventure-filled story . . . packed [with] the human capacity for love.\u201d\n\u2013USA Today\n\u201cA superbly executed, good-hearted farce that is part romance and part mystery . . . With Tan\u2019s many talents on display, it\u2019s her idiosyncratic wit and sly observations . . . that make this book pure pleasure.\u201d\n\u2013San Francisco Chronicle\nSan Francisco art patron Bibi Chen has planned a journey of the senses along the famed Burma Road for eleven lucky friends. But after her mysterious death, Bibi watches aghast from her ghostly perch as the travelers veer off her itinerary and embark on a trail paved with cultural gaffes and tribal curses, Buddhist illusions and romantic desires. On Christmas morning, the tourists cruise across a misty lake and disappear.\nWith picaresque characters and mesmerizing imagery, Saving Fish from Drowning gives us a voice as idiosyncratic, sharp, and affectionate as the mothers of The Joy Luck Club. Bibi is the observant eye of human nature\u2013the witness of good intentions and bad outcomes, of desperate souls and those who wish to save them. In the end, Tan takes her readers to that place in their own heart where hope is found.\n\u201cAmy Tan is among our great storytellers.\u201d\n\u2013The New York Times Book Review\n\u201cAmy Tan has created an almost magical adventure that, page by page, becomes a metaphor for human relationships.\u201d\n\u2013Isabel Allende\n\u201cWith humor, ruthlessness, and wild imagination, Tan has reaped [a] fantastic tale of human longings and (of course) their consequences.\u201d\n\u2013Elle\n\u201cA book that\u2019s easy to read and hard to forget.\u201d\n\u2013Newsweek"], "title": ["Saving Fish from Drowning"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780345464019", "Publisher: Random House Publishing Group", "Publication date: 9/26/2006", "Series:\nBallantine Reader's Circle Series", "Edition description: Reprint", "Pages: 528", "Sales rank: 217566", "Product dimensions: 5.19 (w) x 8.00 (h) x 1.06 (d)"], "authors": ["Amy Tan"]}
