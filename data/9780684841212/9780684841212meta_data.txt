{"overview": ["Bob Slocum was living the American dream. He had a beautiful wife, three lovely children, a nice house...and all the mistresses he desired. He had it all \u2014 all, that is, but happiness. Slocum was discontent. Inevitably, inexorably, his discontent deteriorated into desolation until...something happened.\nSomething Happened is Joseph Heller's wonderfully inventive and controversial second novel satirizing business life and American culture. The story is told as if the reader was overhearing the patter of Bob Slocum's brain \u2014 recording what is going on at the office, as well as his fantasies and memories that complete the story of his life. The result is a novel as original and memorable as his Catch-22.\nAs revealing today as when it was first published, this brilliant novel by the author of Picture This expresses the concerns of an entire generation in its black comedy. World War II flier John Yossarian decides that his only mission each time he goes up is to return--alive!"], "title": ["Something Happened"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780684841212", "Publisher: Simon & Schuster", "Publication date: 11/12/1997", "Pages: 576", "Sales rank: 245600", "Product dimensions: 5.60 (w) x 8.40 (h) x 1.40 (d)"], "authors": ["Joseph Heller"]}
