{"overview": ["Inside the abbey of a Benedictine monastery on tiny Egret Island, just off the coast of South Carolina, resides a beautiful and mysterious chair ornately carved with mermaids and dedicated to a saint who, legend claims, was a mermaid before her conversion. Jessie Sullivan\u2019s conventional life has been \u201cmolded to the smallest space possible.\u201d So when she is called home to cope with her mother\u2019s startling and enigmatic act of violence, Jessie finds herself relieved to be apart from her husband, Hugh. Jessie loves Hugh, but on Egret Island\u2014amid the gorgeous marshlands and tidal creeks\u2014she becomes drawn to Brother Thomas, a monk who is mere months from taking his final vows. What transpires will unlock the roots of her mother\u2019s tormented past, but most of all, as Jessie grapples with the tension of desire and the struggle to deny it, she will find a freedom that feels overwhelmingly right.\nWhat inspires the yearning for a soul mate? Few writers have explored, as Kidd does, the lush, unknown region of the feminine soul where the thin line between the spiritual and the erotic exists. The Mermaid Chair is a vividly imagined novel about the passions of the spirit and the ecstasies of the body; one that illuminates a woman\u2019s self-awakening with the brilliance and power that only a writer of Kidd\u2019s ability could conjure."], "title": ["The Mermaid Chair"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780670033942", "Publisher: Penguin Group (USA) Incorporated", "Publication date: 4/5/2005", "Pages: 352", "Sales rank: 256191", "Product dimensions: 5.75 (w) x 8.50 (h) x 1.13 (d)"], "authors": ["Sue Monk Kidd"]}
