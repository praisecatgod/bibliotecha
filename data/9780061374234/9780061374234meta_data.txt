{"overview": ["\"Born mute, speaking only in sign, Edgar Sawtelle leads an idyllic life with his parents on their farm in remote northern Wisconsin. For generations, the Sawtelles have raised and trained a fictional breed of dog whose thoughtful companionship is epitomized by Almondine, Edgar's lifelong friend and ally. But with the unexpected return of Claude, Edgar's paternal uncle, turmoil consumes the Sawtelles' once peaceful home. When Edgar's father dies suddenly, Claude insinuates himself into the life of the farm - and into Edgar's mother's affections.\" Grief-stricken and bewildered, Edgar tries to prove Claude played a role in his father's death, but his plan backfires - spectacularly. Forced to flee into the vast wilderness lying beyond the farm, Edgar comes of age in the wild, fighting for his survival and that of the three yearling dogs who follow him. But his need to face his father's murderer and his devotion to the Sawtelle dogs turn Edgar ever homeward."], "title": ["The Story of Edgar Sawtelle"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780061374234", "Publisher: HarperCollins Publishers", "Publication date: 9/8/2009", "Series:\nOprah's Book Club Series", "Edition description: Reprint", "Pages: 608", "Sales rank: 69454", "Product dimensions: 8.06 (w) x 5.66 (h) x 0.28 (d)"], "authors": ["David Wroblewski"]}
