{"overview": ["In Windows, there's a control panel, dialog box, console, or wizard to manage every component of a system. There are thousands of them\u2014so many that it can be nearly impossible to keep track of all the locations and settings one needs to administer Windows effectively. PowerShell provides administrators with a single, unified command line from which they can control and automate every aspect of Windows.\nLearn Windows PowerShell in a Month of Lunches is an innovative tutorial designed for busy administrators. Author Don Jones has taught thousands of administrators to use PowerShell, and now he brings his years of training techniques to a concise, easy-to-follow book. Just set aside one hour a day\u2014lunchtime would be perfect\u2014for an entire month, and readers will be automating administrative tasks faster than they ever thought possible.\nPurchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning. Also available is all code from the book."], "title": ["Learn Windows PowerShell in a Month of Lunches"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9781617290213", "Publisher: Manning Publications Company", "Publication date: 5/14/2011", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 425", "Sales rank: 493205", "Product dimensions: 7.30 (w) x 9.20 (h) x 0.80 (d)"], "authors": ["Don Jones"]}
