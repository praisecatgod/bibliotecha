{"overview": ["Condoleezza Rice has excelled as a diplomat, political scientist, and concert pianist.\u00a0 Her achievements run the gamut from helping to oversee the collapse of communism in Europe and the decline of the Soviet Union, to working to protect the country in the aftermath of 9-11, to becoming only the second woman - and the first black woman ever -- to serve as Secretary of State.\n\u00a0\nBut until she was 25 she never learned to swim.\n\u00a0\nNot because she wouldn't have loved to, but because when she was a little girl in Birmingham, Alabama, Commissioner of Public Safety Bull Connor decided he'd rather shut down the city's pools than give black citizens access.\n\u00a0\nThroughout the 1950's, Birmingham's black middle class largely succeeded in insulating their children from the most corrosive effects of racism, providing multiple support systems to ensure the next generation would live better than the last.\u00a0 But by 1963, when Rice was applying herself to her fourth grader's lessons, the situation had grown intolerable.\u00a0 Birmingham was an environment where blacks were expected to keep their head down and do what they were told -- or face violent consequences. That spring two bombs exploded in Rice\u2019s neighborhood amid a series of chilling Klu Klux Klan attacks.\u00a0 Months later, four young girls lost their lives in a particularly vicious bombing.\n\u00a0\nSo how was Rice able to achieve what she ultimately did?\n\u00a0\nHer father, John, a minister and educator, instilled a love of sports and politics.\u00a0 Her mother, a teacher, developed Condoleezza\u2019s passion for piano and exposed her to the fine arts.\u00a0 From both, Rice learned the value of faith in the face of hardship and the importance of giving back to the community.\u00a0 Her parents\u2019 fierce unwillingness to set limits propelled her to the venerable halls of Stanford University, where she quickly rose through the ranks to become the university\u2019s second-in-command.\u00a0 An expert in Soviet and Eastern European Affairs, she played a leading role in U.S. policy as the Iron Curtain fell and the Soviet Union disintegrated.\u00a0 Less than a decade later, at the apex of the hotly contested 2000 presidential election, she received the exciting news \u2013 just shortly before her father\u2019s death \u2013 that she would go on to the White House as the first female National Security Advisor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs comfortable describing lighthearted family moments as she is recalling the poignancy of her mother\u2019s cancer battle and the heady challenge of going toe-to-toe with Soviet leaders, Rice holds nothing back in this remarkably candid telling. This is the story of Condoleezza Rice that has never been told, not that of an ultra-accomplished world leader, but of a little girl \u2013 and a young woman -- trying to find her place in a sometimes hostile world and of two exceptional parents, and an extended family and community, that made all the difference.\nFrom the Hardcover edition."], "title": ["Extraordinary, Ordinary People: A Memoir of Family"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780307888471", "Publisher: Crown Publishing Group", "Publication date: 10/11/2011", "Edition description: Reprint", "Pages: 368", "Sales rank: 112512", "Product dimensions: 7.94 (w) x 5.22 (h) x 0.84 (d)"], "authors": ["Condoleezza Rice"]}
