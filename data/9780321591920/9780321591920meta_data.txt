{"overview": ["This book covers Flash CS4, including all the features brand new for Flash users. Flash CS4 introduces motion tweening, a new method for animating objects, such as symbols and text fields. Using a new panel, the Motion Editor, Flash developers will find it easier than ever to create sophisticated, lifelike animations. In addition, inverse kinematics allows animators to create armatures, skeleton-like structures that connect symbols and govern their movement. The animation chapters of the Flash CS4 Visual Quickstart Guide will be fully updated to integrate the new animation techniques with the old and to give beginners some insight into how and when to use which types. Flash CS4 Professional: Visual QuickStart Guide uses step-by-step instructions and plenty of screenshots to guide readers along so that they\u2019ll be up and running quickly."], "title": ["Flash CS4 Professional for Windows and Macintosh: Visual QuickStart Guide (Visual QuickStart Guide Series)"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780321591920", "Publisher: Peachpit Press", "Publication date: 12/29/2008", "Series:\nVisual QuickStart Guide Series", "Pages: 573", "Product dimensions: 6.90 (w) x 8.90 (h) x 1.30 (d)"], "authors": ["Katherine Ulrich"]}
