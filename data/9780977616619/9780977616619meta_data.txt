{"overview": ["Are you a tester who spends more time manually creating complex test data than using it? A business analyst who seemingly went to college all those years so you can spend your days copying data from reports into spreadsheets? A programmer who can't finish each day's task without having to scan through version control system output, looking for the file you want?\nIf so, you're wasting that computer on your desk. Offload the drudgery to where it belongs, and free yourself to do what you should be doing: thinking. All you need is a scripting language (free!), this book (cheap!), and the dedication to work through the examples and exercises.\nEveryday Scripting with Ruby is divided into four parts. In the first, you'll learn the basics of the Ruby scripting language. In the second, you'll see how to create scripts in a steady, controlled way using test-driven design. The third part is about finding, understanding, and using the work of others\u2014and about preparing your scripts for others to use. The fourth part, more advanced, is about saving even more time by using application frameworks.\nReaders will be introduced to the Ruby scripting language and the overall craft of scripting in this reference. Common typos, finished scripts ready to use and deploy for testing and other common rote tasks are included."], "title": ["Everyday Scripting with Ruby: For Teams, Testers, and You (Facets of Ruby Series)"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780977616619", "Publisher: Pragmatic Bookshelf", "Publication date: 12/28/2006", "Series:\nFacets of Ruby Series", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 310", "Sales rank: 1048887", "Product dimensions: 7.50 (w) x 8.94 (h) x 0.94 (d)"], "authors": ["Brian Marick"]}
