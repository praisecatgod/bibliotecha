{"overview": ["Ajax, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, exploded onto thescene in the spring of 2005 and remains the hottest story among webdevelopers. With its rich combination of technologies, Ajax provides astrong foundation for creating interactive web applications with XML orJSON-based web services by using JavaScript in the browser to processthe web server response.\nAjax Design Patterns shows you bestpractices that can dramatically improve your web development projects.It investigates how others have successfully dealt with conflictingdesign principles in the past and then relays that informationdirectly to you.\nThe patterns outlined in the book fall into fourcategories:\n\nFoundational technology: Examines the raw technologiesrequired for Ajax development\nProgramming: Exposes techniques that developers havediscovered to ensure their Ajax applications are maintainable\nFunctionality and usability: Describes the types of userinterfaces you'll come across in Ajax applications, as well as the newtypes of functionality that Ajax makes possible\nDevelopment: Explains the process being used to monitor,debug, and test Ajax applications\n\n\n\nAjax Design Patterns will also get you upto speed with core Ajax technologies, such as XMLHttpRequest, the DOM, and JSON.Technical discussions are followed by code examples so you can see foryourself just what is-and isn't-possible with Ajax. This handyreference will help you to produce high-quality Ajax architectures,streamline web application performance, and improve the userexperience.\nMichael Mahemoff holds a PhD in ComputerScience and Software Engineering from the University of Melbourne, where his thesiswas \"Design Reuse in Software Engineering and Human-ComputerInteraction.\" He lives in London and consults on software developmentissues in banking, health care, and logistics.\n\"Michael Mahemoff's Ajax Design Patternsis a truly comprehensive compendium of webapplication design expertise, centred around but not limited to Ajaxtechniques. Polished nuggets of design wisdom are supportedby tutorials and real-world code examples resulting in a book thatserves not only as an intermediate to expert handbook but also as anextensive reference for building rich interactive web applications.\"\n\u2014Brent Ashley, remote scripting pioneer\nWith sections on foundational technology patterns, programming patterns, functionality and usability patterns, and diagnosis/testing of Ajax applications, this guide focuses on delivering usability in the face of constraints."], "title": ["Ajax Design Patterns"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780596101800", "Publisher: O'Reilly Media, Incorporated", "Publication date: 7/5/2006", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 656", "Product dimensions: 9.06 (w) x 10.88 (h) x 1.14 (d)"], "authors": ["Michael Mahemoff"]}
