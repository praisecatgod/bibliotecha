{"overview": ["Filled with fresh interpretations and information, puncturing old myths and challenging new ones, Battle Cry of Freedom will unquestionably become the standard one-volume history of the Civil War.\nJames McPherson's fast-paced narrative fully integrates the political, social, and military events that crowded the two decades from the outbreak of one war in Mexico to the ending of another at Appomattox. Packed with drama and analytical insight, the book vividly recounts the momentous episodes that preceded the Civil War\u2014the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry\u2014and then moves into a masterful chronicle of the war itself\u2014the battles, the strategic maneuvering on both sides, the politics, and the personalities. Particularly notable are McPherson's new views on such matters as the slavery expansion issue in the 1850s, the origins of the Republican Party, the causes of secession, internal dissent and anti-war opposition in the North and the South, and the reasons for the Union's victory.\nThe book's title refers to the sentiments that informed both the Northern and Southern views of the conflict: the South seceded in the name of that freedom of self-determination and self-government for which their fathers had fought in 1776, while the North stood fast in defense of the Union founded by those fathers as the bulwark of American liberty. Eventually, the North had to grapple with the underlying cause of the war\u2014slavery\u2014and adopt a policy of emancipation as a second war aim. This \"new birth of freedom,\" as Lincoln called it, constitutes the proudest legacy of America's bloodiest conflict.\nThis authoritative volume makes sense of that vast and confusing \"second American Revolution\" we call the Civil War, a war that transformed a nation and expanded our heritage of liberty.\nFilled with fresh interpretations and information, puncturing old myths and challenging new ones, Battle Cry of Freedom will unquestionably become the standard one-volume history of the Civil War. A fast-paced narrative integrates the political, social and military events from the outbreak in Mexico to the ending at Appomattox."], "title": ["Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780195168952", "Publisher: Oxford University Press", "Publication date: 12/11/2003", "Series:\nOxford History of the United States Series", "Pages: 952", "Sales rank: 46640", "Product dimensions: 9.20 (w) x 5.90 (h) x 1.70 (d)"], "authors": ["James M.
