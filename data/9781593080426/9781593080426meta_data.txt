Henry mastered the art of the humorous, energetic tale that ends with a sudden, ironic twist. In \u201cAfter Twenty Years,\u201d for example, two boys agree to meet at a particular spot exactly twenty years later. Both are faithful, but in the intervening years one boy has turned into a criminal, the other into a policeman. Behind the rendezvous lurks a powerful dramatic situation with a fascinating moral dilemma\u2014all dealt with in a few brief pages.\nThis is just one of the many literary gems in Selected Stories of O. Henry, a collection of 45 of O. Henry\u2019s most renowned and entertaining short stories. Each one offers insights into human nature and the ways it is affected by love, hate, wealth, poverty, gentility, disguise, and crime\u2014themes that ran through the author\u2019s own life. Born William Sidney Porter, O. Henry started writing while in prison for embezzlement. Later he moved to New York, and his tales romanticizing the commonplace, particularly the life of ordinary New Yorkers, became highly popular. The most widely read author of his time, O. Henry died penniless but left behind a wealth of short stories that endure as classics of the genre.\nVictoria Blake is a freelance writer.
