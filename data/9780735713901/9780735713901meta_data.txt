{"overview": ["Whether you're a hobbyist or a budding game design pro, your objective is probably the same: To create the coolest games possible using today's increasingly sophisticated technology. To do that, however, you need to understand some basic math and physics concepts. Not to worry: You don't need to go to night school if you get this handy guide! Through clear, step-by-step instructions, author Wendy Stahler covers the trigonometry snippets, vector operations, and 1D/2D/3D motion you need to improve your level of game development. Each chapter includes exercises to make the learning stick, and Visualization Experience sections are sprinkled throughout that walk you through a demo of the chapter's content. By the end of the volume, you'll have a thorough understanding of all of the math and physics concepts, principles, and formulas you need to control and enhance your user's gaming experience."], "title": ["Beginning Math and Physics for Game Programmers"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9781584504580", "Publisher: Cengage Learning", "Publication date: 5/11/2006", "Series:\nGame Development Series", "Edition description: 1ST", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 752", "Product dimensions: 7.40 (w) x 9.20 (h) x 1.80 (d)", "ISBN-13: 9781592005178", "Publisher: Cengage Learning", "Publication date: 10/22/2004", "Edition description: BK&CD-ROM;", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 320", "Sales rank: 635010", "Product dimensions: 7.36 (w) x 9.10 (h) x 0.86 (d)", "ISBN-13: 9780735713901", "Publisher: New Riders", "Publication date: 3/24/2004", "Series:\nNew Riders Games Series", "Pages: 475", "Product dimensions: 7.40 (w) x 9.10 (h) x 1.20 (d)"], "authors": ["Allen Sherrod", "Ron Penton", "Wendy Stahler", "Kaveh Kahrizi", "Dustin Clingman", "Kaveh Kahrizi (With)", "Dustin Clingman (With)"]}
