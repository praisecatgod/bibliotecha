{"overview": ["C++ is a powerful, highly flexible, and adaptable programming language that allows software engineers to organize and process information quickly and effectively. But this high-level language is relatively difficult to master, even if you already know the C programming language. This new second edition of Practical C++ Programming is a complete introduction to the C++ language for programmers who are learning C++. Reflecting the latest changes to the C++ standard, this new edition takes a practical down-to-earth approach, placing a strong emphasis on how to design clean, useful code. In short, to-the-point chapters, all aspects of programming are covered, including style, software engineering, programming design, object-oriented design, and debugging. The book also covers common mistakes and how to find (and avoid) them. End-of-chapter exercises help you ensure that you've mastered the material.\n\n                        \n C++ primer, practical style guide and a debugger \"how-to\" all in one. Many examples instruct by having you debug programs. For those with no programming experience, C programmers moving to C++, and C++ programmers itching to fine-tune.
