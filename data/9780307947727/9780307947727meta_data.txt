Tony thought he left this all behind as he built a life for himself, and his career has provided him with a secure retirement and an amicable relationship with his ex-wife and daughter, who now has a family of her own. But when he is presented with a mysterious legacy, he is forced to revise his estimation of his own nature and place in the world.\nWinner of the 2011 Man Booker Prize\nShortlisted for the 2011 Costa Novel Award"], "title": ["The Sense of an Ending"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780307947727", "Publisher: Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group", "Publication date: 5/29/2012", "Series:\nVintage International Series", "Pages: 176", "Sales rank: 33690", "Product dimensions: 5.43 (w) x 8.00 (h) x 0.53 (d)"], "authors": ["Julian Barnes"]}
