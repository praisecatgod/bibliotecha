{"overview": ["For any woman who has ever had a love/hate relationship with food and with how she looks; for anyone who has knowingly or unconsciously used food to try to fill the hole in his heart or soothe the craggy edges of his psyche, Fat Girl is a brilliantly rendered, angst-filled coming-of-age story of gain and loss. From the lush descriptions of food that call to mind the writings of M.F.K. Fisher at her finest, to the heartbreaking accounts of Moore\u2019s deep longing for family and a sense of belonging and love, Fat Girl stuns and shocks, saddens and tickles."], "title": ["Fat Girl: A True Story"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780452285859", "Publisher: Penguin Group (USA) Incorporated", "Publication date: 2/28/2006", "Edition description: Reprint", "Pages: 208", "Sales rank: 306916", "Product dimensions: 5.10 (w) x 7.75 (h) x 0.46 (d)"], "authors": ["Judith Moore"]}
