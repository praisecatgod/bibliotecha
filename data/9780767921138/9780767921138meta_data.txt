{"overview": ["\u201cNature\u2019s quintessential color combination of blue and white never ceases to amaze me. The look of pristine snow against deep blue Aspen skies; spires of blue and white delphinium in a garden; Connecticut\u2019s spring mornings where the apple blossoms and nodding heads of white narcissus are in contrast to soft blue skies and vibrant green grass\u2014these and many more images found in nature have informed my work for the last thirty-five years. From fashion to interiors, and tabletop to gardens, the presence of blue and white is a constant in my past collections as well as throughout my previous eight books. It seems natural that I would eventually do a book on living and designing with this seminal color combination.\u201d\n\u2014from the Introduction\n\nThis private tour of the dazzling homes of legendary style-setter Carolyne Roehm showcases her favorite color combination in more than three hundred glorious photographs.\nFrom the time designer Carolyne Roehm rented her first small apartment in New York in her twenties, she has loved blue and white. In that one-bedroom flat, she draped the walls, chairs, sofa, and a canopy bed in an inexpensive blue and white sheeting fabric designed by her boss, Oscar de la Renta, and began collecting blue-and-white porcelain from around the world\u2014initially bargain reproductions and eventually museum-quality pieces\u2014from China, Japan, Portugal, the Netherlands, and elsewhere.\nToday, Carolyne Roehm presides over a magnificent duplex in Manhattan, an antique-filled stone house in Connecticut, and a chic yet rustic home in Aspen, all of which contain rooms decorated in blue and white, featuring accents from her collections of china, ceramics, glassware, linens, furniture, and decorative pieces. These rooms employ the whole spectrum of blues, from delicate sky to the deepest, boldest navy, evoking moods ranging from tranquil to vibrant.\nIn A Passion for Blue and White, Carolyne Roehm takes us inside her homes (including her former pied-\u00e0-terre in Paris) in never-before-seen photographs of these stunning rooms. She also reveals how she has used blue and white to magnificent effect outdoors in Connecticut around her pool and in her gardens\u2014and even how she used the combination in designing a wedding for a friend.\nShe provides inspiration for tabletop design, flower arranging, and gift-wrapping, suitable for all budgets. Her ceramic, textile, and glass collections (endless sources of her creativity) can be emulated by anyone with trips to flea markets, thrift shops, and inexpensive import stores as well as antique stores and galleries.\nA swatch of French fabric began Carolyne Roehm\u2019s lifetime love affair with blue and white. In this book, she demonstrates through her own decorating and designs, how this combination works its magic on everything from upholstery and drapes to napkins and tablecloths, wrapping paper and ribbons. For anyone with a passion for blue and white, here is the ultimate style guide and Carolyne Roehm\u2019s most gorgeous book yet."], "title": ["Passion for Blue and White"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780767921138", "Publisher: Crown Publishing Group", "Publication date: 10/28/2008", "Pages: 288", "Sales rank: 231710", "Product dimensions: 10.20 (w) x 12.10 (h) x 1.00 (d)"], "authors": ["Carolyne Roehm"]}
