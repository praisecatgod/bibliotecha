{"overview": ["For JavaScript developers working on increasingly large and complex projects, effective automated testing is crucial to success. Test-Driven JavaScript Development is a complete, best-practice guide to agile JavaScript testing and quality assurance with the test-driven development (TDD) methodology. Leading agile JavaScript developer Christian Johansen covers all aspects of applying state-of-the-art automated testing in JavaScript environments, walking readers through the entire development lifecycle, from project launch to application deployment, and beyond. \nUsing real-life examples driven by unit tests, Johansen shows how to use TDD to gain greater confidence in your code base, so you can fearlessly refactor and build more robust, maintainable, and reliable JavaScript code at lower cost. Throughout, he addresses crucial issues ranging from code design to performance optimization, offering realistic solutions for developers, QA specialists, and testers.\nCoverage includes\n\u2022 Understanding automated testing and TDD\n\u2022 Building effective automated testing workflows\n\u2022 Testing code for both browsers and servers (using Node.js)\n\u2022 Using TDD to build cleaner APIs, better modularized code, and more robust software\n\u2022 Writing testable code\n\u2022 Using test stubs and mocks to test units in isolation\n\u2022 Continuously improving code through refactoring\n\u2022 Walking through the construction and automated testing of fully functional software\nThe accompanying Web site, tddjs.com, contains all of the book\u2019s code listings and additional resources."], "title": ["Test-Driven JavaScript Development"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780321683915", "Publisher: Addison-Wesley", "Publication date: 9/23/2010", "Series:\nDeveloper's Library Series", "Pages: 497", "Sales rank: 1379572", "Product dimensions: 6.90 (w) x 8.90 (h) x 1.10 (d)"], "authors": ["Ellie Quigley", "Christian Johansen"]}
