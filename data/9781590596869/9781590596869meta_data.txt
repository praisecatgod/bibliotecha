{"overview": ["Beginning Rails is the practical starting point for anyone wanting to learn how to build dynamic web applications using the Rails framework for Ruby. You\u2019ll learn how all of the components of Rails fit together and how you can leverage them to create sophisticated web applications with less code and more joy.\nThis book is particularly well suited to those with little or no experience with web application development, or who have some experience but are new to Rails. Beginning Rails assumes basic familiarity with web terms and technologies, but doesn't require you to be an expert.\nTopics include:\n\nA gentle introduction to the Ruby programming language\nInstalling Ruby and Rails on a Mac, Linux, or Windows system\nThe philosophy behind Rails and why it matters\nThe Model-View-Controller architecture\nThe basics of relational databases and SQL\nSetting up a MySQL database and creating a schema with migrations\nExperimenting with your live application in the Rails console\nCreating rich relationships between your models\nUsing controllers and templates properly\nLeveraging helpers to keep your templates clean and logic free\nAdding Ajax and visual effects to enrich your user interfaces\nJavaScript with Prototype and script.aculo.us\nHow to send and receive mail from your application\nUsing and creating your own plug-ins\nEnsuring your code against Murphy\u2019s Law through writing tests\nUsing Capistrano to deploy your application\n\nRather than delving into the arcane details of Rails, the focus is on the aspects of the framework that will become your pick, shovel, and axe. Part history lesson, part introduction to object-oriented programming, and part dissertation on open source software, Beginning Rails doesn\u2019t just explain how to do something in Rails, it explains why.\nEvery programmer fondly remembers the book that helped them get started. The goal of Beginning Rails is to become that book for you, today.\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroducing the Rails Framework\nGetting Started\nGetting Something Running\nWorking with a Database: Active Record\nAdvanced Active Record: Enhancing Your Models\nAction Pack:Working with the View and the Controller\nImproving Interaction with Ajax\nSending and Receiving Mail\nTesting Your Application\nExtending Rails with Plugins\nDeploying Your Rails Applications"], "title": ["Beginning Rails: From Novice to Professional"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9781590596869", "Publisher: Apress", "Publication date: 8/3/2007", "Series:\nExpert's Voice Series", "Edition description: 1st Corrected ed. 2007.
