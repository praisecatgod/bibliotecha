{"overview": ["In this irresistible novel, Sarah Addison Allen, author of the New York Times bestselling debut, Garden Spells, tells the tale of a young woman whose family secrets\u2014and secret passions\u2014are about to change her life forever.\nJosey Cirrini is sure of three things: winter is her favorite season, she\u2019s a sorry excuse for a Southern belle, and sweets are best eaten in the privacy of her closet. For while Josey has settled into an uneventful life in her mother\u2019s house, her one consolation is the stockpile of sugary treats and paperback romances she escapes to each night\u2026. Until she finds her closet harboring Della Lee Baker, a local waitress who is one part nemesis\u2014and two parts fairy godmother. With Della Lee\u2019s tough love, Josey\u2019s narrow existence quickly expands. She even bonds with Chloe Finley, a young woman who is hounded by books that inexplicably appear when she needs them\u2014and who has a close connection to Josey\u2019s longtime crush. Soon Josey is living in a world where the color red has startling powers, and passion can make eggs fry in their cartons. And that\u2019s just for starters.\nBrimming with warmth, wit, and a sprinkling of magic, here is a spellbinding tale of friendship, love\u2014and the enchanting possibilities of every new day."], "title": ["The Sugar Queen"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780553384840", "Publisher: Random House Publishing Group", "Publication date: 4/14/2009", "Edition description: Reprint", "Pages: 304", "Sales rank: 113846", "Product dimensions: 8.24 (w) x 5.54 (h) x 0.66 (d)"], "authors": ["Sarah Addison Allen"]}
