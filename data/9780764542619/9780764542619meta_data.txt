{"overview": ["RUTH REICHL\n \"Mary Frances [Fisher] has the extraordinary ability to make the ordinary seem rich and wonderful. Her dignity comes from her absolute insistence on appreciating life as it comes to her.\"\nJULIA CHILD\n\"How wonderful to have here in my hands the essence of M.F.K. Fisher, whose wit and fulsome opinions on food and those who produce it, comment upon it, and consume it are as apt today as they were several decades ago, when she composed them. Why did she choose food and hunger she was asked, and she replied, 'When I write about hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth, and the love of it . . . and then the warmth and richness and fine reality of hunger satisfied.' This is the stuff we need to hear, and to hear again and again.\"\nALCIE WATERS\n\"This comprehensive volume should be required reading for every cook. It defines in a sensual and beautiful way the vital relationship between food and culture.\""], "title": ["The Art of Eating: 50th Anniversary Edition"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780764542619", "Publisher: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "Publication date: 2/23/2004", "Edition description: 50th Anniversary Edition", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 784", "Sales rank: 175688", "Product dimensions: 6.13 (w) x 9.24 (h) x 2.08 (d)"], "authors": ["M.
