{"overview": ["One Year ago, Sarah Palin burst onto the national political stage like a comet. Yet even now, few Americans know who this remarkable woman really is.\nAs chief executive of America's largest state, Sarah Palin had built a record as a reformer who pushed through changes other politicians only talked about: Energy independence. Ethics reform. And the biggest private sector energy infrastructure project in U.S. history. She was also a Main Street American woman: a working mom, wife of a blue-collar union man, and mother of five children.\nIn this eagerly anticipated memoir, Palin paints an intimate portrait of growing up in the wilds of Alaska; meeting her life-long love; her decision to enter politics; the importance of faith and family; and the unique joys and trials of life as a high-profile working mother. She also opens up for the first time about the 2008 presidential race, providing a rare, mom's-eye view of high-stakes national politics-from patriots dedicated to \"Country First\" to slick politicos bent on winning at any cost.\nGoing Rogue traces one ordinary citizen's extraordinary journey, and imparts Palin's vision of a way forward for America and her unfailing hope in the greatest nation on earth."], "title": ["Going Rogue: An American Life"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780061939907", "Publisher: HarperCollins Publishers", "Publication date: 8/24/2010", "Pages: 431", "Sales rank: 197224", "Product dimensions: 5.90 (w) x 8.90 (h) x 1.30 (d)"], "authors": ["Sarah Palin"]}
