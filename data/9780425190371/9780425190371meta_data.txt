{"overview": ["From the New York Times best-selling author of The Dovekeepers...\nFor more than two hundred years, the Owens women had been blamed for everything that went wrong in their Massachusetts town. And Gillian and Sally endured that fate as well; as children, the sisters were outsiders. Their elderly aunts almost seemed to encourage the whispers of witchery, but all Gillian and Sally wanted was to escape. One would do so by marrying, the other by running away. But the bonds they shared brought them back-almost as if by magic...\nThe newest novel by the author of Turtle Moon reveals what happens when magic competes with real love. At the heart of this tantalizing novel are Gillian and Sally Owens, whose conjuring spinster aunts raised them not with square meals and curfews but with magic spells and respect for the powers of nature."], "title": ["Practical Magic"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780425190371", "Publisher: Penguin Group (USA) Incorporated", "Publication date: 8/5/2003", "Edition description: Reissue", "Pages: 304", "Sales rank: 89066", "Product dimensions: 4.94 (w) x 7.90 (h) x 0.80 (d)"], "authors": ["Alice Hoffman"]}
