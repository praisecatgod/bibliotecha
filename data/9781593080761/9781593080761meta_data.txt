Among their leaders was Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose essays, lectures, and poems defined the American transcendentalist movement, though he himself disliked the term.\nEmerson advocates a rejection of fear-driven conformity, a total independence of thought and spirit, and a life lived in harmony with nature. He believes that Truth lies within each individual, for each is part of a greater whole, a universal \u201cover-soul\u201d through which we transcend the merely mortal.\nEmerson was extremely prolific throughout his life; his collected writings fill forty volumes. This edition contains his major works, including Nature, the essays \u201cSelf-Reliance,\u201d \u201cThe American Scholar,\u201d \u201cThe Over-Soul,\u201d \u201cCircles,\u201d \u201cThe Poet,\u201d and \u201cExperience,\u201d, and such important poems as \u201cThe Rhodora,\u201d \u201cUriel,\u201d \u201cThe Humble-Bee,\u201d \u201cEarth-Song,\u201d \u201cGive All to Love,\u201d and the well-loved \u201cConcord Hymn.\u201d\nIncludes a comprehensive glossary of names.\nPeter Norberg has been Assistant Professor of English at Saint Joseph\u2019s University in Philadelphia since 1997.
