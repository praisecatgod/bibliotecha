{"overview": ["The internationally bestselling novel by the author of A Kiss Before Dying, The Boys from Brazil, and Rosemary's Baby\n\nWith an Introduction by Peter Straub\nFor Joanna, her husband, Walter, and their children, the move to beautiful Stepford seems almost too good to be true. It is. For behind the town's idyllic facade lies a terrible secret \u2014 a secret so shattering that no one who encounters it will ever be the same.\nAt once a masterpiece of psychological suspense and a savage commentary on a media-driven society that values the pursuit of youth and beauty at all costs, The Stepford Wives is a novel so frightening in its final implications that the title itself has earned a place in the American lexicon."], "title": ["Stepford Wives"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780060080846", "Publisher: HarperCollins Publishers", "Publication date: 7/28/2002", "Series:\nHarper Perennial", "Edition description: 1st Perennial Edition", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 144", "Sales rank: 207182", "Product dimensions: 5.31 (w) x 8.00 (h) x 0.32 (d)"], "authors": ["Ira Levin", "Peter Straub (Introduction)"]}
