{"overview": ["The Department of Justice Watches Over the Law\nBut Who Watches the Watchmen?\nThe Department of Justice is America\u2019s premier federal law enforcement agency. And according to J. Christian Adams, it\u2019s also a base used by leftwing radicals to impose a fringe agenda on the American people.\nA five-year veteran of the DOJ and a key attorney in pursuing the New Black Panther voter intimidation case, Adams recounts the shocking story of how a once-storied federal agency, the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights division has degenerated into a politicized fiefdom for far-left militants, where the enforcement of the law depends on the race of the victim.\nIn Injustice, Adams reveals:\n\nThe inside story of how the Obama DOJ spiked the voter intimidation lawsuit against the New Black Panther Party\u2014and the Panthers\u2019 little-known public appearance with Obama\nHow the Obama administration changed DOJ hiring policy to ensure radical leftists would dominate the Civil Rights Division\nThe Obama DOJ\u2019s bizarre agenda, from insisting on kids\u2019 rights to attend school dressed as transvestites, to litigating for teachers\u2019 rights to take paid vacations to Mecca\nHow the DOJ has repeatedly sided with political bosses who flagrantly disenfranchise entire communities of white voters\nWhy the DOJ\u2019s fixation on racial grievance threatens the integrity of the 2012 elections\n\nIf you thought the federal government was dedicated to race-neutral equal protection, Injustice will set you straight.
