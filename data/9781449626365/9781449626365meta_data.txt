{"overview": ["While forensic analysis has proven to be a valuable investigative tool in the field of computer security, utilizing anti-forensic technology makes it possible to maintain a covert operational foothold for extended periods, even in a high-security environment. Adopting an approach that favors full disclosure, the updated Second Edition of The Rootkit Arsenal presents the most accessible, timely, and complete coverage of forensic countermeasures. This book covers more topics, in greater depth, than any other currently available. In doing so the author forges through the murky back alleys of the Internet, shedding light on material that has traditionally been poorly documented, partially documented, or intentionally undocumented.\nThe range of topics presented includes how to:\n-Evade post-mortem analysis\n-Frustrate attempts to reverse engineer your command & control modules\n-Defeat live incident response\n-Undermine the process of memory analysis\n-Modify subsystem internals to feed misinformation to the outside\n-Entrench your code in fortified regions of execution\n-Design and implement covert channels\n-Unearth new avenues of attack"], "title": ["The Rootkit Arsenal: Escape And Evasion In The Dark Corners Of The System"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9781449626365", "Publisher: Jones & Bartlett Learning", "Publication date: 3/16/2012", "Edition number: 2", "Pages: 784", "Sales rank: 525366", "Product dimensions: 6.00 (w) x 9.00 (h) x 1.60 (d)"], "authors": ["Stuart McClure", "Joel Scambray", "George Kurtz", "Bill Blunden"]}
