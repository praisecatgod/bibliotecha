{"overview": ["This project-based guide from Adobe will teach readers all they need to know to create engaging interactive content with Flash CS3. Using step-by-step instructions with projects that build on the knowledge learned in each lesson, readers will learn the key elements of the Flash interface, including panels, timelines, and frames. From there, readers will learn how to work with vector and bitmap graphics; create and edit symbols; modify text and add interactivity with ActionScript 3.0; and incorporate animation, music, and sound to their projects. They'll also learn how to prepare and export their finished projects for Web and broadcast. Of course, readers will also learn how to take advantage of the new features of Flash CS3--the streamlined user interface, native support for Photoshop and Illustrator files, revamped drawing tools, new video encoding features, code editing enhancements, and much more. The companion CD provides users with all the sample files they need to complete all of the projects. \nEducational instructor notes\u2014created to help teachers plan, organize, and time their lessons\u2014are available for this book (and for other Classroom in a Book titles) at www.peachpit.com/instructorresources."], "title": ["Adobe Flash CS3 Professional Classroom in a Book"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9781590597330", "Publisher: Apress", "Publication date: 3/6/2007", "Edition description: 1st ed. 2007.
