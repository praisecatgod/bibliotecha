{"overview": ["\u201cA big American story with big American themes\u201d (Elle) from the author of the New York Times\u0096bestselling memoir The Mistress\u2019s Daughter\nIn this vivid, transfixing new novel, A. M. Homes presents a darkly comic look at twenty-first-century domestic life and the possibility of personal transformation. Harold Silver has spent a lifetime watching his more successful younger brother, George, acquire a covetable wife, two kids, and a beautiful home in the suburbs of New York City. When George\u2019s murderous temper results in a shocking act of violence, both men are hurled into entirely new lives. May We Be Forgiven digs deeply into the near biblical intensity of fraternal relationships, our need to make sense of things, and our craving for connection. It is an unnerving tale of unexpected intimacies and of how one deeply fractured family might begin to put itself back together."], "title": ["May We Be Forgiven: A Novel"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780147509703", "Publisher: Penguin Group (USA)", "Publication date: 9/24/2013", "Pages: 496", "Sales rank: 175161", "Product dimensions: 5.40 (w) x 8.30 (h) x 1.10 (d)"], "authors": ["A.
