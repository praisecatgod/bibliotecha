{"overview": ["One of the New York Times Book Review's 10 Best Books of 2012\nSet in northwest London, Zadie Smith\u2019s brilliant tragicomic novel follows four locals\u2014Leah, Natalie, Felix, and Nathan\u2014as they try to make adult lives outside of Caldwell, the council estate of their childhood. In private houses and public parks, at work and at play, these Londoners inhabit\u00a0a complicated place, as beautiful as it is brutal, where the thoroughfares hide the back alleys and taking the high road can sometimes lead you to a dead end. Depicting the modern urban zone\u2014familiar to city-dwellers everywhere\u2014NW is a quietly devastating novel of encounters, mercurial and vital, like the city itself.\nOne of the New York Times Book Review's Top 10 Books of 2012"], "title": ["NW"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780143123934", "Publisher: Penguin Group (USA)", "Publication date: 8/27/2013", "Pages: 416", "Sales rank: 122914", "Product dimensions: 5.40 (w) x 8.40 (h) x 1.00 (d)"], "authors": ["Zadie Smith"]}
