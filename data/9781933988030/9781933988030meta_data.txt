{"overview": ["Prototype and Scriptaculous are libraries that extend standard Ajax. They make it easier to program Ajax and provide powerful features like drag and drop and animation. In this book, developers learn by playing and see how the libraries work in the real world.\nAs experience with Ajax increases, developers want the standard Ajax capabilities they repeatedly use to be preprogrammed for them\u2014and that's exactly what Ajax libraries do for them. They reduce the pain of handling cross-browser inconsistencies, they add useful language features, and provide sophisticated functionality. Of these, Prototype is the most popular JavaScript and Ajax framework for low-level user interface features such as animation, drag and drop, and pre-built widgets. Together, they free the developer up to concentrate on building the application. They make a rich user experience easy to achieve.\nThis book guides the reader through the Prototype and Scriptaculous libraries feature-by-feature. In just 350 pages, readers will find over 100 small working examples to help them explore the libraries. As well, they will develop a web-based image gallery that teacher them how to use Prototype and Scriptaculous in the real-world.\nPurchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning. Also available is all code from the book."], "title": ["Prototype and Scriptaculous in Action"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9781590596678", "Publisher: Apress", "Publication date: 10/20/2006", "Series:\nThe Expert's Voice in Open Source Series", "Edition description: 2007", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 272", "Sales rank: 1070711", "Product dimensions: 0.57 (w) x 7.50 (h) x 9.25 (d)", "ISBN-13: 9781933988030", "Publisher: Manning Publications Company", "Publication date: 3/1/2007", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 544", "Product dimensions: 7.40 (w) x 9.18 (h) x 1.11 (d)"], "authors": ["Lee Babin", "L.
