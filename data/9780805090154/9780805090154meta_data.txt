{"overview": ["America in the \u2019aughts\u2014hilariously skewered, brilliantly dissected, and darkly diagnosed by one of the country\u2019s most prominent social critics\nNow in paperback, Barbara Ehrenreich\u2019s widely acclaimed This Land Is Their Land takes the measure of what we are left with after the cruelest decade in memory and finds lurid extremes all around. While members of the moneyed elite have bought up congressmen, many in the working class can barely buy lunch. While a wealthy minority obsessively consumes cosmetic surgery, the poor often go without health care for their children. And while the Masters of the Universe have thrown themselves into the casino economy, the less fortunate have been fed a diet of morality, marriage, and abstinence. With perfect satiric pitch, Ehrenreich reveals a country scarred by deepening inequality, corroded by distrust, and shamed by its official cruelty.\nFull of wit and generosity, these reports from a divided nation\u2014including new and unpublished essays\u2014confirm once again that Ehrenreich is, as the San Francisco Chronicle proclaims, \u201cessential reading.\u201d"], "title": ["This Land Is Their Land: Reports from a Divided Nation"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780805090154", "Publisher: Holt, Henry & Company, Inc.", "Publication date: 4/27/2009", "Edition description: First Edition", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 256", "Sales rank: 334167", "Product dimensions: 8.20 (w) x 5.12 (h) x 0.67 (d)"], "authors": ["Barbara Ehrenreich"]}
