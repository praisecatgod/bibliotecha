{"overview": ["A classic of American political thought, The Federalist Papers is a series of eighty-five essays by three authors\u2014Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay\u2014the purpose of which was to gain support for the proposed new Constitution of the United States, a document that many considered too radical. Most of the \u201cpapers\u201d were published in periodicals as the vote on approving it drew near. Without the support of these powerfully persuasive essays, the Constitution mostly likely would not have been ratified and America might not have survived as a nation.\nBeginning with an assault upon the country\u2019s first constitution, the Articles of Confederation, the authors of The Federalist Papers present a masterly defense of the new system. Hamilton, Madison, and Jay\u2014three of our most influential founders\u2014comment brilliantly on issue after issue, whether it be the proper size and scope of government, taxation, or impeachment. Today lawmakers and politicians frequently invoke these commentaries, more than 200 years after they first appeared.\nWritten in haste and during a time of great crisis in the new American government, the articles were not expected to achieve immortality. Today, however, many historians consider The Federalist Papers as the third most important political document in American history, just behind the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution itself. They have become the benchmark of American political philosophy, and the best explanation of what the Founding Fathers were trying to achieve."], "title": ["The Federalist (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9781593082826", "Publisher: Barnes & Noble", "Publication date: 2/1/2006", "Series:\nBarnes & Noble Classics Series", "Pages: 560", "Sales rank: 147622"], "authors": ["Alexander Hamilton", "John Jay", "Robert Ferguson (Introduction)", "James Madison"]}
