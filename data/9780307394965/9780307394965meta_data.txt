{"overview": ["\"In January 1945, in the waning mouths of World War II, a small group of people begin the longest journey of their lives: an attempt to cross the remnants of the Third Reich, from the Russian front to the Rhine if necessary, to reach the British and American lines.\" \"Among the group is eighteen-year-old Anna Emmerich, the daughter of Prussian aristocrats. There is her lover, Callum Finella, a twenty-year-old Scottish prisoner of war who was brought from the stalag to her family's farm as forced labor. And there is a twenty-six-year-old Wehrmacht corporal, who the pair know as Manfred - who is, in reality, Uri Singer, a Jew from Germany who managed to escape a train bound for Auschwitz.\" \"As they work their way west, they encounter a countryside ravaged by war. Their flight will test both Anna's and Callum's love, as well as their friendship with Manfred - assuming any of them even survive.\" Perhaps not since The English Patient has a novel so deftly captured both the power and poignancy of romance and the terror and tragedy of war. Skillfully portraying the flesh and blood of history, Chris Bohjalian has crafted a rich tapestry that puts a face on one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies - while creating, perhaps, a masterpiece that will haunt readers for generations."], "title": ["Skeletons at the Feast"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780307394965", "Publisher: Crown Publishing Group", "Publication date: 2/10/2009", "Pages: 400", "Sales rank: 104654", "Product dimensions: 5.10 (w) x 7.90 (h) x 1.00 (d)"], "authors": ["Chris Bohjalian"]}
