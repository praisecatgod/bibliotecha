{"overview": ["This book picks up right where Learning Perl leaves off. With Intermediate Perl, you\u2019ll graduate from short scripts to much larger programs, using features that make Perl a general-purpose language. This gentle but thorough guide introduces you to modules, complex data structures, and object-oriented programming.\nEach chapter is small enough to be read in just an hour or two, ending with exercises to help you practice what you\u2019ve learned. If you\u2019re familiar with the material in Learning Perl and have the ambition to go further, Intermediate Perl will teach you most of the core Perl language concepts you need for writing robust programs on any platform.\nTopics include:\n\nPackages and namespaces\nReferences and scoping, including regular expression references\nManipulating complex data structures\nObject-oriented programming\nWriting and using modules\nTesting Perl code\nContributing to CPAN\n\nJust like Learning Perl, material in this book closely follows the popular introductory Perl course the authors have taught since 1991. This second edition covers recent changes to the language up to version 5.14.\nDescribed as the book that turns the Perl dabbler into the Perl programmer, this book is about making the leap from the easy things to the hard ones. It is written by the bestselling authors of \"Learning Pearl\" and offers a gentle but thorough introduction to intermediate programming in Perl."], "title": ["Intermediate Perl"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780596102067", "Publisher: O'Reilly Media, Incorporated", "Publication date: 3/15/2006", "Edition description: 2nd ed.", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 280", "Product dimensions: 6.90 (w) x 9.40 (h) x 0.70 (d)"], "authors": ["Randal L.
