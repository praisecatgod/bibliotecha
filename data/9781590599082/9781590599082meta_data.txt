{"overview": ["As a web developer, you\u2019ll already know that JavaScript is a powerful language, allowing you to add an impressive array of dynamic functionality to otherwise static web sites. But there is more power waiting to be unlocked\u2014JavaScript is capable of full object\u0096oriented capabilities, and by applyingobject-oriented principles, best practices, and design patterns to your code, you can make it more powerful, more efficient, and easier to work with alone or as part of a team.\nWith Pro JavaScript Design Patterns, you\u2019ll start with the basics of object\u0096oriented programming in JavaScript applicable to design patterns, including making JavaScript more expressive, inheritance, encapsulation, information hiding, and more. With that covered, you can kick\u0096start your JavaScript development in the second part of the book, where you\u2019ll find detail on how to implement and take advantage of several design patterns in JavaScript, including composites, decorators, fa\u00e7ades, adapters, and many more.\nEach chapter is packed with real\u0096world examples of how the design patterns are best used and expert advice on writing better code, as well as what to watch out for. Along the way you\u2019ll discover how to create your own libraries and APIs for even more efficient coding.\n\nMaster the basics of object\u0096oriented programming in JavaScript, as they apply to design patterns\nApply design patterns to your kick\u0096start your JavaScript development\nWork through several real\u0096world examples\n\nWhat you\u2019ll learn\n\nHow to apply object\u0096oriented programming techniques in JavaScript\nHow to take advantage of inheritance, interfaces, and encapsulation and information hiding to kick\u0096start your JavaScript development\nHow to implement several design patterns in your JavaScript projects, including factory, fa\u00e7ade, bridge, composite, adapter, decorator, flyweight, proxy, command, observer, and chain of responsibility\nHow to make your code easier to manage in a team environment, as well as on your own\nHow to create your own libraries and APIs\n\nWho this book is for\nThis book will be an invaluable learning tool for any experienced JavaScript developer.\nTable of Contents\n\nExpressive JavaScript\nInterfaces\nEncapsulation and Information Hiding\nInheritance\nThe Singleton Pattern\nChaining\nThe Factory Pattern\nThe Bridge Pattern\nThe Composite Pattern\nThe Facade Pattern\nThe Adapter Pattern\nThe Decorator Pattern\nThe Flyweight Pattern\nThe Proxy Pattern\nThe Observer Pattern\nThe Command Pattern\nThe Chain of Responsibility Pattern"], "title": ["Pro JavaScript Design Patterns"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9781590599082", "Publisher: Apress", "Publication date: 12/17/2007", "Series:\nThe Expert's Voice in Web Development Series", "Edition description: 2008", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 269", "Product dimensions: 9.25 (w) x 7.50 (h) x 0.62 (d)"], "authors": ["Ross Harmes", "Dustin Diaz"]}
