{"overview": ["Uncle Tom's Cabin, by Harriet Beecher Stowe, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classics\u00a0series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics:\nAll editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.\n\u00a0\nNearly every young author dreams of writing a book that will literally change the world. A few have succeeded, and Harriet Beecher Stowe is such a marvel. Although the American anti-slavery movement had existed at least as long as the nation itself, Stowe\u2019s Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin (1852) galvanized public opinion as nothing had before. The book sold 10,000 copies in its first week and 300,000 in its first year. Its vivid dramatization of slavery\u2019s cruelties so aroused readers that it is said Abraham Lincoln told Stowe her work had been a catalyst for the Civil War.\nToday the novel is often labeled condescending, but its characters\u2014Tom, Topsy, Little Eva, Eliza, and the evil Simon Legree\u2014still have the power to move our hearts. Though \"Uncle Tom\u201d has become a synonym for a fawning black yes-man, Stowe\u2019s Tom is actually American literature\u2019s first black hero, a man who suffers for refusing to obey his white oppressors. Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin is a living, relevant story, passionate in its vivid depiction of the cruelest forms of injustice and inhumanity\u2014and the courage it takes to fight against them.\nAmanda Claybaugh is Assistant Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University."], "title": ["Uncle Tom's Cabin (Barnes & Noble Classics Series)"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9781593081218", "Publisher: Barnes & Noble", "Publication date: 2/1/2005", "Series:\nBarnes & Noble Classics Series", "Pages: 496", "Sales rank: 25719", "Product dimensions: 7.96 (w) x 5.30 (h) x 1.32 (d)"], "authors": ["Harriet Beecher Stowe"]}
