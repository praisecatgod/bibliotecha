{"overview": ["In this groundbreaking historical expose, Douglas A. Blackmon brings to light one of the most shameful chapters in American history\u2014an \u201cAge of Neoslavery\u201d that thrived from the aftermath of the Civil War through the dawn of World War II.Using a vast record of original documents and personal narratives, Douglas A. Blackmon unearths the lost stories of slaves and their descendants who journeyed into freedom after the Emancipation Proclamation and then back into the shadow of involuntary servitude shortly thereafter. By turns moving, sobering, and shocking, this unprecedented account reveals the stories of those who fought unsuccessfully against the re-emergence of human labor trafficking, the companies that profited most from neoslavery, and the insidious legacy of racism that reverberates today.\n\n                        2009 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction Winner!"], "title": ["Slavery By Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780385722704", "Publisher: Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group", "Publication date: 1/13/2009", "Edition description: Reprint", "Pages: 496", "Sales rank: 64018", "Product dimensions: 7.98 (w) x 5.12 (h) x 1.03 (d)"], "authors": ["Douglas A.
