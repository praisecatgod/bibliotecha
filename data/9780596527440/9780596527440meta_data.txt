{"overview": ["Learn to build dynamic, interactive web applications using the two most important approaches to web development today: Ajax and the phenomenally efficient Ruby on Rails platform. This book teaches intermediate to advanced web developers how to use both Ajax and Rails to quickly build high-performance, scalable applications without being overwhelmed with thousands of lines of JavaScript code. More than just recipes, you also get a thorough, low-level understanding of what's happening under the hood.\n\nAjax on Rails includes three fully worked out Rails/Ajax applications, and quick reference sections for Prototype and script.aculo.us.\nTesting lessons show you how to eliminate cross-browser JavaScript errors and DOM debugging nightmares using a combination of Firebug, and Venkman.\nAdvanced material explains the most current design practices for Ajax usability. You'll learn to avoid user experience mistakes with proven design patterns.\n\nBeyond the how-to, Ajax on Rails helps you consider when Ajax is (and isn't) appropriate, and the trade-offs associated with it. For those new to Rails, this book provides a quick introduction, the big picture, a walk through the installation process, and some tips on getting started. If you've already started working with Rails and seek to deepen your skill set, you'll find dozens of examples drawn from real-world projects, exhaustive reference for every relevant feature, and expert advice on how to \"Ajaxify\" your applications.\n\n                        \"Ajax on Rails\" teaches readers how to use both Ajax and Ruby on Rails to quickly build high-performance, scalable Web applications without being overwhelmed with thousands of lines of JavaScript code."], "title": ["Ajax on Rails: Build Dynamic Web Applications with Ruby"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780596527440", "Publisher: O'Reilly Media, Incorporated", "Publication date: 12/28/2006", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 352", "Product dimensions: 7.06 (w) x 9.18 (h) x 0.81 (d)"], "authors": ["Scott Raymond"]}
