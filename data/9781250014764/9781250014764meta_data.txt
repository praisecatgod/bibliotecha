Or can there be a new story, written for today and alive to the realities of feminism, sexual freedom, prenups, and divorce?\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s the early 1980s. In American colleges, the wised-up kids are inhaling Derrida and listening to Talking Heads. But Madeleine Hanna, dutiful English major, is writing her senior thesis on Jane Austen and George Eliot, purveyors of the marriage plot that lies at the heart of the greatest English novels. As Madeleine studies the age-old motivations of the human heart, real life, in the form of two very different guys, intervenes\u2014-the charismatic and intense Leonard Bankhead, and her old friend the mystically inclined Mitchell Grammaticus. As all three of them face life in the real world they will have to reevaluate everything they have learned. Jeffrey Eugenides creates a new kind of contemporary love story in \"his most powerful novel yet\" (Newsweek)."], "title": ["The Marriage Plot"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9781250014764", "Publisher: Picador", "Publication date: 9/4/2012", "Edition description: Reprint", "Pages: 416", "Sales rank: 119593", "Product dimensions: 5.40 (w) x 8.20 (h) x 0.80 (d)"], "authors": ["Jeffrey Eugenides"]}
