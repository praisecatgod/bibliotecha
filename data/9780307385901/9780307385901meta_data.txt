{"overview": ["A gripping, best-selling narrative based on one refugee's story of escape from war-torn Sudan.\nIn a heartrending and astonishing novel, Eggers illuminates the history of the civil war in Sudan through the eyes of Valentino Achak Deng, a refugee now living in the United States. We follow his life as he's driven from his home as a boy and walks, with thousands of orphans, to Ethiopia. Valentino's travels bring him in contact with government soldiers, janjaweed-like militias, liberation rebels, hyenas and lions, disease and starvation-and unexpected romances. In this audiobook, written with expansive humanity and surprising humor, we come to understand the nature of the conflicts in Sudan, the refugee experience in America, the dreams of the Dinka people, and the challenge one man faces in a world collapsing around him."], "title": ["What Is the What"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780307385901", "Publisher: Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group", "Publication date: 10/9/2007", "Edition description: Reprint", "Pages: 560", "Sales rank: 81702", "Product dimensions: 5.10 (w) x 7.90 (h) x 0.90 (d)"], "authors": ["Dave Eggers"]}
