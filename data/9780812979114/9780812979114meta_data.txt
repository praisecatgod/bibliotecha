{"overview": ["NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER\nThey met over their dogs. Gail Caldwell and Caroline Knapp (author of Drinking: A Love Story) became best friends, talking about everything from their love of books and their shared history of a struggle with alcohol to their relationships with men. Walking the woods of New England and rowing on the Charles River, these two private, self-reliant women created an attachment more profound than either of them could ever have foreseen. Then, several years into this remarkable connection, Knapp was diagnosed with cancer. With her signature exquisite prose, Caldwell mines the deepest levels of devotion, and courage in this gorgeous memoir about treasuring a best friend, and coming of age in midlife. Let\u2019s Take the Long Way Home is a celebration of the profound transformations that come from intimate connection\u2014and it affirms, once again, why Gail Caldwell is recognized as one of our bravest and most honest literary voices.\nLook for special features inside.\nJoin the Circle for author chats and more.\nRandomHouseReadersCircle.com"], "title": ["Let's Take the Long Way Home: A Memoir of Friendship"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780812979114", "Publisher: Random House Publishing Group", "Publication date: 8/9/2011", "Pages: 224", "Sales rank: 109774", "Product dimensions: 7.76 (w) x 5.30 (h) x 0.58 (d)"], "authors": ["Gail Caldwell"]}
