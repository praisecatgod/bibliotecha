{"overview": ["If you're like most developers, you rely heavily on JavaScript to build interactive and quick-responding web applications. The problem is that all of those lines of JavaScript code can slow down your apps. This book reveals techniques and strategies to help you eliminate performance bottlenecks during development. You'll learn how to improve execution time, downloading, interaction with the DOM, page life cycle, and more.\nYahoo! frontend engineer Nicholas C. Zakas and five other JavaScript experts\u2014Ross Harmes, Julien Lecomte, Steven Levithan, Stoyan Stefanov, and Matt Sweeney\u2014demonstrate optimal ways to load code onto a page, and offer programming tips to help your JavaScript run as efficiently and quickly as possible. You'll learn the best practices to build and deploy your files to a production environment, and tools that can help you find problems once your site goes live.\n\nIdentify problem code and use faster alternatives to accomplish the same task\nImprove scripts by learning how JavaScript stores and accesses data\nImplement JavaScript code so that it doesn't slow down interaction with the DOM\nUse optimization techniques to improve runtime performance\nLearn ways to ensure the UI is responsive at all times\nAchieve faster client-server communication\nUse a build system to minify files, and HTTP compression to deliver them to the browser"], "title": ["High Performance JavaScript"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9780596802790", "Publisher: O'Reilly Media, Incorporated", "Publication date: 4/15/2010", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 242", "Sales rank: 937586", "Product dimensions: 6.90 (w) x 9.10 (h) x 0.50 (d)"], "authors": ["Nicholas C.
