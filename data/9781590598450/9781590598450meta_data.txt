{"overview": ["Object-oriented programming (OOP) is something that is usually considered a black art for hardcore programmers, not a topic of conversation for Flash developers. However, when adobe introduced ActionScript 3.0 to the mix, it changed everything. ActionScript 3.0 is much more powerful than previous versions, allowing Flash developers to produce robust object-oriented applications. But with that power comes great responsibility--OOP is now a requirement, rather than optional, and there are new things to learn.\nThis book, based on the ever-popular Object-Oriented ActionScript for Flash 8, provides you all you need to delve into the world of OOP with confidence, whether you are using the Flash IDE, Flex builder, or even command-line tools for your development work.\nFirst, you are taken gently through all the principles of OOP that you need to know, and then given a guide to designing and implementing applications in ActionScript 3.0. Next, we step up a gear, showing you the Flex builder development environment and teaching about creating reusable, extensible component frameworks, manager classes, animation and effects classes, UI widgets, and more. lastly, we look at some more advanced topics such as communication between Flash and the browser and Web services. case studies are included that apply the knowledge presented, giving you real-world projects to learn from and adapt for use in your own work.\nMastering object-oriented programming is essential for modern Flash development, and Object-Oriented ActionScript 3.0 is the only guide you'll need."], "title": ["Object-Oriented ActionScript 3.0"], "details": ["ISBN-13: 9781590597910", "Publisher: Apress", "Publication date: 4/9/2007", "Edition description: 1st ed. 2007. 2nd printing 2008", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 568", "Sales rank: 1280564", "Product dimensions: 9.25 (w) x 7.50 (h) x 1.16 (d)", "ISBN-13: 9781590598450", "Publisher: Apress", "Publication date: 7/23/2007", "Series:\nFriends of ED Adobe Learning Library", "Edition number: 1", "Pages: 640", "Product dimensions: 9.25 (w) x 7.50 (h) x 1.35 (d)"], "authors": ["Keith Peters", "Peter Elst", "Todd Yard", "Sas Jacobs"]}
